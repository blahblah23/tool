notes

self laughs during Es displacement.
Es tgt is disabled for 1 s while being displaced.
ems using flash during Es castime still be entirely affected (dmg, disabling, displacement)

E can make ems go over walls (circumstances permitting)
E always attempt to displace ems so they land behind self.
ems may sometimes be displaced sideways if self approached them diagonally (caused by him not facing in their dir when casting E)

possible bug: slow-immune ems wont be rooted when flung into mega adhesive.
