cd: '22+-3.0&5' 

active: self give E for 1.5 s
if self blocks abil she restores mana.

mana restored: '80+15.0&5'

tgting         no tgt
affects        self

notes

E can block dragon auto atk thus preventing dmg and giving self mana.
the initial knockup when dragon is 1st dmgd cant be blocked.

depending on Es timing of cosmic binding it blocks either 1st hit dmg or stun, but not both.
